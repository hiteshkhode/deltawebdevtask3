# Polling site

### PURPOSE
The goal of the project was creation of a web based polling application, where a participant can create a team of people who are supposed to make a decision out of a poll and the team members with their credentials will have to log in and submit their vote.

### Steps
- Clone the git repo into your local machine with the command given below.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/hiteshkhode/polling-site.git
```
- After succesfully cloning the repo, change the directory to newly cloned git repo/directory and install all the necessary packages and dependencies. Following are the commands for the same.
```sh
cd polling-site
npm i
```
- The website utilises SQL database, add your database credentials (host, user, password, databasename) into ~/index.js, and then you are good to go...

### About
The application is based out of vanilla CSS, HTML, JavaScript and nothing fancy.

#### DEVELOPER'S NOTE
> This is an example of a centralized application created in initial days of my "web dev" journey. Now, I'm in favour of something decentralized, > something which will not be such extensively vulnerable to curreuption, hijacking, and central failure. If anybody's interested, we can hop on > something similar.
